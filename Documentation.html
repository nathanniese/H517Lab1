        <h3>Design Choices</h3>

        For this project I made a few design choices to make my elements stand out. The first graph I created was the street graph that shows the location of pumps and deaths, I decided to try to make the map, as close as possible, to the original map.
        So, I chose a black and white map along with circles to represent pumps and rectangle to represent deaths. I tried to add depth to the roads by creating two parallel lines centered on the original line, but this created a confusing looking map,
        more specifically it made it look like a crossing your eyes while looking at the map, so I keep with the original one line per street look. To show the specifics of each death I included a mouse over function that brings a small window indicating
        the age and gender of each death, the css was very easy to work with and looked great I found it at the link above for the css
        created by KJ Schmidt. I also made the specific death stand out more, so you can see which death you are selecting by changing to the color and making it slightly larger. I also included some major streets by finding specific points in the map and comparing
        it to the original map on the web, I did the same for the workhouse and Brewery. Because there is a lot on this graph I included the ability to zoom and pan in and out.</br></br>

        The Next chart I created was the death by day chart, to start I created a static bar chart that showed how many people died each day. To represent the date, I used the date at the bottom of the chart however it was too long and over lapped, so I rotated the text
        making it much easier to read. I then added a mouse over effect that when chosen the selected bar would affect the number of deaths on the previous deaths map
        it also changed opacity, so it was clear what bar was chosen. I then implemented the ability to select a time span I decided that being able to select one date, by clicking on the bar, then mouse over the other. I realized that since one is being selected the chart should be able to mouse
        over both time before and after, making it more fluent. I also decided that a person can choose to show all deaths after a point by clicking and all before by mouse over. To indicate what is selected, when clicked, I decided to change the color of the bar. After creating the
        chart we had a class were we discussed why a line charts with circles is a better way to show data using time, so I changed it to line graph with circle points.</br></br>

        On the third and last chart I decided a bar chart would be enough to represent the data. I ordered the data in increasing age order and split the gender using two colors blue to represent males and red for females. While pink and blue have been traditionally used
        to represent male and female, I thought Blue and red would be easier to see the difference, specifically for visually challenged people, so I added a legend to show what color represent what gender.
